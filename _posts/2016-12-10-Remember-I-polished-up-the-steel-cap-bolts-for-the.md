Remember I polished up the steel cap bolts for the rocker and crank covers? No, well I did but it seems they don&#39;t like our English weather.<br /><br />So I researched replacements only to discover they are over a well tenner each and there is about 20 of them.<br /><br />Time for an alternative &quot;solution&quot;.<br /><br />I thought about just having them chromed, but that ain&#39;t cheap either. Nickel plated, same.<br /><br />How about diy Nickel plating? Mmmm, cheaper. Then I found this article on indestructible <br /><br /><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/High-Quality-and-safe-Nickel-Plating/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.instructables.com/id/High-Quality-and-safe-Nickel-Plating/</a><br /><br />Looks safe enough and cheap enough, how hard can it be. <br /><br />Turns out very simple.ï»¿
